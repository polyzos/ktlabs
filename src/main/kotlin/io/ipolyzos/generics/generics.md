Type Projection
===============
- Kotlin offers uss-site variance
   - When it's impossible to have variance on the type
- Define it on the call
  - Creates a restricted form of the type
  - This is known as a **type projection**
- **Star projections** are a safe way to indicate a subtype of a projection
